An easy solution for performing basic tasks with PDF files that are often locked behind 
a paywall in popular software.

This program is a simple wrapper for some of the functionality offered by the `pypdf`
library, packaged in a Tkinter GUI. It's intended audience is an everyday office
employee, even those that are not technically-inclined, looking for a quick and easy 
way to perform some actions not offered in the free version of the most popular PDF 
viewer/editor.
